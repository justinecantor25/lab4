<h1> Minute by Minute</h1>
    <p><i> Minute-by-Minute</i> This editorial magazine blends real stories, literature, short fiction, personal essays, illustrations, and photography to explore the quiet details we often overlook. Moving fluidly between the tactile and the conceptual, it reveals how our memories and lives scatter across the world around us. Through its images and reflections, the magazine invites readers to slow down, notice the hidden corners of their own lives, and find meaning in what’s usually unseen.</p>
    <h2>Issue 01: Ubiquity</h2>
        <p>The first issue explores how fragments of ourselves—our memories, relationships, and experiences—are scattered throughout the world, hidden in the small, often overlooked details around us. Even in moments of solitude, the presence of these traces in objects we see, touch, smell, or hear reminds us that we are never truly alone. Through stories, essays, images, and reflections, this issue invites readers to notice the subtle echoes of life and memory in the everyday world, discovering the quiet companionship these fragments offer.</p>
